_Sometimes I'm quiet and don't join in because I don't have a topic and don't fit in with your topics (°¯᷄◠¯᷅°) But I like listening to the conversation ╹ .̮ ╹_

**I don't like copycats, especially when they claim it as their own property and accuse the original of being a copycat** ( •̀_•́ )

And one more thing, if you don't want to be friends with me anymore, just say it, I'll accept it, rather than you just ignoring me for no reason, it makes me confused and curious :)
